# test.cmd

This batch file will create a file called test.exe

## test.exe
This program will write "steve_was_here" to "C:\program" (note this directory must exist)

The purpose of this is to test if we can get an exe to write to a directory we placed an .exe in (think about unescaped paths and making your exe run instead of the intended one)
